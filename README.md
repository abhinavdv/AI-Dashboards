# AI-Dashboards
AI-Dashboards is an innovative project aimed at leveraging artificial intelligence to simplify the creation and interaction with data dashboards.
- The first iteration focuses on generating intuitive dashboards from datasets by interpreting column meanings and providing an out-of-the-box user experience. 
- Users can interact with the dashboard using voice commands to create and modify graphs, enhancing accessibility and usability. 
- The project envisions a modular system for adding various graph types, allowing users to easily customize their data visualizations. 

### Iteration 1:
- Use AI to create a dashboard based on a given dataset and context on what the columns mean.
    - How do we understand the columns in the dataset?
    - How do we give a good first dashboard out of the box?
    - Use OpenAI O1 for this?

- Create graphs using voice commands.
    - Once the initial dashboard is created, how do we interact with it?
    - How do we update a graph to something else we want?
    - How do we extend the dashboard with more graphs?

## Example
The example is cricket data. It has been downloaded from data.world. https://data.world/raghav333/cricket-players-espn/workspace/file?filename=SuperCleaned.csv



Ideas:
- Create a modular system where we can add more types of graphs as we want.
- Like excel naming a1,a2,a3, b1, b2 b3
- Ask things like make a bar chart for abc in c4
- combine a1-b4 to make a single chart for def

Chanllenges:
- How do me make AI undersrtand UI elements?
